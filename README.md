# gpuRcublas: The Simple CUDA cuBLAS Interface for R
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gpuRcore/gpuRcublas.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gpuRcore/gpuRcublas)


Welcome to gpuRcublas!  This package is designed to be an extension upon the
more general [gpuRcuda](https://github.com/gpuRcore/gpuRcuda) package.  Essentially,
this package provides the linear algebra routines not implemented in 
[gpuRcuda](https://github.com/gpuRcore/gpuRcuda).  The key aspect of this
package is to allow the user to use a CUDA backend while also leveraging
the cublas library.

The syntax is designed to be identical to [gpuR](https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR)
